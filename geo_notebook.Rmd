# Outline: 
* Reading and plotting raster data
* Raster calculations
* Reading and plotting vector data
* Combined vector and raster manipulation
    * Example 1: calculating a buffer around the flux tower
    * Example 2: extracting time-series data from a multi-band raster
* Extras: reprojecting data, nice-looking plots

# 1. Reading and plotting raster data
### First, let's look at raster metadata using GDALinfo
```{r}
GDALinfo("./data/HARV_dsmCrop.tif")
```
### Load raster
Note: raster() will create a single-band raster. stack() and brick() can be used to load/create a multi-band raster (more on that later)
```{r}
harv_dsm <- raster("./data/HARV_dsmCrop.tif")
harv_dsm
```
### We can plot a raster using base R plotting...
```{r}
plot(harv_dsm)
```
### ...or using ggplot (after creating a data.frame with the data from our raster)
```{r}
harv_dsm_df <- as.data.frame(harv_dsm, xy = TRUE)
str(harv_dsm_df)
```
```{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_raster(data = harv_dsm_df, aes(x, y, fill = HARV_dsmCrop)) + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c()
```

# 2. Raster calculations
### Let's calculate canopy height from a DSM (digital surface model) and a DTM (digital terrain model) 
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("canopy_height.png")
```
### Let's read in our digital terrain model
```{r}
harv_dtm <- raster("./data/HARV_dtmCrop.tif")
plot(harv_dtm)
```
### Raster math: we can perform calculations between two rasters
Let's calculate canopy height by subtracting the DTM from the DSM
```{r}
harv_canopy <- harv_dsm - harv_dtm
plot(harv_canopy)
```
### Raster math can be slow for large rasters or complex calculations...an alternative is to use overlay
```{r}
harv_canopy <- overlay(harv_dsm, harv_dtm, 
                       fun = function(r1, r2) { return( r1 - r2) })
plot(harv_canopy)
```
### We can also do calculations between rasters and integers
Let's calculate the mean height in our DTM and subtract that from our DTM
```{r}
harv_dtm2 <- harv_dtm - cellStats(harv_dtm, stat='mean')
plot(harv_dtm2)
```
### Raster calc with logical expressions
```{r}
harv_dtm3 <- calc(harv_dtm, function(x) ifelse(x > 340, x, NA))
plot(harv_dtm3)
```
### Saving our canopy height model for future use: 
Let's write a GeoTiff file. R will recognize the desired output file type based on the file extension (see documentation for options)
```{r}
writeRaster(harv_canopy, "./data/HARV_canopy_height.tif")
```

## Exercise: come up with your own raster calculation and see if it works! Discuss with your neighbor

# 3. Reading and plotting vector data
### Let's read in a shapefile with the boundary of our field site: 
Using the sp package: 
```{r}
aoi_sp <- shapefile("./data/HarClip_UTMZ18.shp")
aoi_sp
plot(aoi_sp)
```
### Now let's read in the same shapefile using the sf ("simple features") package: 
```{r}
library(sf)
aoi <- st_read("./data/HarClip_UTMZ18.shp")
```

```{r}
plot(aoi)
```
### Let's try another shapefile with multiple objects: 
```{r}
ne_states <- st_read("./data/Boundary-US-State-NEast.shp")
head(ne_states)
plot(ne_states)
names(ne_states)
```
### We can plot SF objects with ggplot! 
```{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = ne_states, aes(fill = NAME))
```
### Some common sf-specific commands: 
```{r}
st_bbox(ne_states)
st_crs(ne_states)
```
### Simple features objects also work with many dplyr/tidyr type commands:
```{r}
nrow(ne_states)
mass <- ne_states %>%
  filter(NAME == "Massachusetts")

ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = mass, aes(fill = NAME))
```
In addition to polygon shapefiles, we can read point and line data: 
```{r}
tower <- st_read("./data/HARVtower_UTM18N.shp")
roads <- st_read("./data/HARV_roads.shp")
site_map <- ggplot(roads) + 
  geom_sf() + 
  geom_sf(data = tower, col = "red", size = 10, shape = "*")
```
Note: ggplot is displaying coordinates as lat/lon, even though our vector data has the UTM projection! 
```{r}
st_crs(tower)
```

# 4. Combining vector and raster data
# Example 1: Let's calculate a 200m buffer around our flux tower 
### Create 200m buffer around flux tower
```{r}
tower_buffer <- st_buffer(tower, 200)
site_map + 
  geom_sf(data = tower_buffer, fill = "green", alpha = 0.2) 
```
### "Clip" canopy height model to 200m around flux tower
Note: We could use crop to clip the raster to the bounding box of an object, but not it's actual boundary
```{r}
canopy_masked <- mask(harv_canopy, tower_buffer)
canopy_masked
plot(canopy_masked)
```
### Instead, maybe we just want the canopy height values for all cells within our buffer
```{r}
buffer_canopy_values <- extract(harv_canopy, tower_buffer)
```
Extract returns a list of vectors (one for each polygon object), but we only have one object so we can unlist the result
```{r}
buffer_canopy_values <- unlist(buffer_canopy_values)
hist(buffer_canopy_values)
```
# Example 2: extracting time series data from multiple rasters 
### Let's find our NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) files and read them in
```{r}
ndvi_files <- list.files("./data/NDVI/", 
                            full.names = TRUE,
                            pattern = ".tif$")
harv_ndvi <- stack(ndvi_files)
harv_ndvi
```
```{r}
crs(harv_ndvi)
```
### Wait, this is a different zone! Let's reproject the raster to UTM zone 18
```{r}
crs(harv_dtm)
harv_ndvi <- projectRaster(harv_ndvi, crs = crs(harv_dtm))
```
### Now, let's calculate mean NDVI on each date
```{r}
ndvi_mean <- cellStats(harv_ndvi, mean)
plot(ndvi_mean)
```
### Instead, let's calculate mean NDVI at our tower location
We could do this by finding the cell overlapping with the tower and extracting the value at that point
```{r}
tower_xy <- st_coordinates(tower)
tower_row <- rowFromY(harv_ndvi, tower_xy[2])
tower_col <- colFromX(harv_ndvi, tower_xy[1])

tower_ndvi <- getValues(harv_ndvi, row = tower_row)[tower_col,]
plot(tower_ndvi)
```
### We can do the same thing using extract (with fewer lines of code!)
```{r}
tower_ndvi <- raster::extract(harv_ndvi, tower)

buffer_ndvi <- raster::extract(harv_ndvi, tower_buffer, fun = mean)
buffer_ndvi
```
### Optional: Let's make this data look a little bit nicer and plot it: 
```{r}
ndvi_ts <- as.data.frame(unlist(buffer_ndvi)[1,])
names(ndvi_ts) <- "meanNDVI"
julian_day <- gsub("X|_HARV_ndvi_crop", "", row.names(ndvi_ts))
origin <- as.Date("2011-01-01")
ndvi_ts$date <- origin + as.integer(julian_day) - 1
ndvi_ts
ggplot(ndvi_ts, aes(date, meanNDVI)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line()
```
### Exercise: Come up with your own analysis using the raster and shapefile data that we have
Remember, our vector data includes roads and our area of interest, in addition to making our own areas using things like st_buffer!
Try to plot your results and discuss it with your neighbor
